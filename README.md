# StateSpaceModels
State-space models are useful for modeling time series data,
and R contains several excellent packages for creating the models.
Unfortunately, using these packages requires knowing many little details,
and I can never remember them. So I put together some recipes.

I describe the recipes on my website.

This repository contains R code for the recipes.
